# Machine learning - Wikipedia

**Machine learning** (**ML**) is a field of inquiry devoted to understanding and building methods that "learn" – that is, methods that leverage data to improve performance on some set of tasks.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup> It is seen as a part of [artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence "Artificial intelligence").

Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as [training data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_data "Training data"), in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup> Machine learning algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications, such as in medicine, [email filtering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_filtering "Email filtering"), [speech recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_recognition "Speech recognition"), [agriculture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture "Agriculture"), and [computer vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision "Computer vision"), where it is difficult or unfeasible to develop conventional algorithms to perform the needed tasks.<sup id="cite_ref-tvt_3-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-tvt-3">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup>

A subset of machine learning is closely related to [computational statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_statistics "Computational statistics"), which focuses on making predictions using computers, but not all machine learning is statistical learning. The study of [mathematical optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization "Mathematical optimization") delivers methods, theory and application domains to the field of machine learning. [Data mining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_mining "Data mining") is a related field of study, focusing on [exploratory data analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratory_data_analysis "Exploratory data analysis") through [unsupervised learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsupervised_learning "Unsupervised learning").<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup>

Some implementations of machine learning use data and [neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_networks) in a way that mimics the working of a [biological brain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain "Brain").<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup>

In its application across business problems, machine learning is also referred to as [predictive analytics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_analytics "Predictive analytics").
